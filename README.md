Sign Language Translator

A sign-language interpreter and translator that can help facilitate conversation between a hearing person and a person who is deaf or hard-of-hearing.

Using Neural Networks, the model recognizes sign language from a webcam. It then converts it into text, and translates into audio. The software also accepts speech input and translates it into a sign language-motions video for the hard-of-hearing user to understand.
